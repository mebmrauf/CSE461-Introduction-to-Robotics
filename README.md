# CSE461 : Introduction to Robotics

This course introduces robotics by discussing basic laws, architectures, control systems, perceiving techniques, and communication. It will also investigate kinematics, motor action, mechanical engineering issues, advanced communication protocols and uses of AI in robotics.

## Course Objective

This course aims to introduce the exciting multi-disciplinary field of robotics to CSE students. We aim to guide the students through the electrical, mechanical, and software aspects of robotics to help them understand the basic principles and the science behind robotics and teach them how to design and develop the hardware and software parts of a basic robot. The objective of CSE461 is to develop the knowledge necessary to understand the theory behind the design of robots and provide hands-on practice on implementing that knowledge. Our goal is to teach the students the following topics that will help them understand robotics and pave the way for future research in advanced robotics.
The main objectives of this course are:

1. Introduce basic laws, architectures, control systems, perceiving techniques, and communication.

2. Introduce kinematics, motor action, mechanical engineering issues, advanced communication protocols, and uses of AI in robotics.

3. Teach how to implement different algorithms to 4DOF arm control, including forward and reverse kinematics, robot control system, and navigation.

4. Introduce camera vision, sensors, machine learning, deep learning, and other AI algorithms related to robot vision.

5. Introduce robot communication protocols including I2C, UART, USB, SPI, RS 485, Canbus, Modbus, LoRa, Bluetooth, RF, Zigbee, Wifi, and other modern protocols.

6. Teach how to design, develop, experiment, and document a robotics project.
